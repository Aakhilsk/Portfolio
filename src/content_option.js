    aboutme: "Hi, I'm Aakhil Shaik â€” an undergraduate student, researcher, and builder at the convergence of artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and quantum computing. I specialize in crafting intelligent systems that go beyond conventional boundaries - from decoding brainwaves for real-time control to developing hybrid quantum-classical models that spot deepfakes with uncanny accuracy. I'm equally passionate about driving impact beyond the codebase. As the Senior Business Development Manager at AIESEC in Amaravati, I led high-stakes outreach campaigns, secured strategic partnerships, and helped hundreds of students access global exchange opportunities. That journey took me to Sri Lanka, where I worked on-ground as a Business Consultant, integrating data analytics to increase student acceptance into top Japanese universities.Whether it's authoring IEEE papers, engineering BCI-controlled games, or leading youth through global development programs,-I bring depth, initiative, and a multidisciplinary mindset to everything I do.",

The system maps EEG signals (P300/Motor Imagery) to control speed, while forearm EMG gestures trigger left/right directional movement.Signals are acquired, filtered, and processed in real time using Python and signal processing libraries. The processed outputs are mapped to keyboard inputs using PyAutoGUI, enabling a responsive, mind-and-muscle-controlled interface. The project demonstrates the potential of hybrid BCI systems for accessible neurogaming and hands-free control interfaces.",
